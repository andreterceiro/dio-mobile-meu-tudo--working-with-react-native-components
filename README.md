In the introduction, teacher reinforced that React (and React Native) uses several components and when we program a mobile application we do not create a component by scratch. Instead of this we build an application using pre builded components.

# Creating a new app

Teacher asked us to run the following command (seems equal to the previous command he passed):

```
npx create expo app components-overview
```

Teacher also passed [this link about components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) in the complimentary materials area.
