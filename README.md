# Introduction

In the introduction, teacher reinforced that React (and React Native) uses several components and when we program a mobile application we do not create a component by scratch. Instead of this we build an application using pre builded components.

# Creating a new app

Teacher asked us to run the following command (seems equal to the previous command he passed):

```
npx create expo app components-overview -t
```

And in the question in the terminal about how template to use please select "Blank (TypeScript).

In the next steps in the introduction teacher only accessed the directory created by the previous command and run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Teacher had to open an emulator in Android Studio. Then in the terminal of the previous command he clicked in the option "a" to run the app in the Android emulator.

Then the blank app was showed in the Android emulator.


# View

Teacher teached us that a View is equivalent to a "<div />" in HTML world.
